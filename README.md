SpringMenu is a sliding menu, similar to AndroidResidemenu, SlidingMenu,
The biggest difference between SpringMenu and other menus is that it gives flexibility bouncing, 
and this project combines the powerful animation elastic library called 
[Rebound](https://github.com/facebook/rebound) provided by Facebook<Br>

## Design Sketch
![SpringMenu](https://github.com/byc4426/SpringMenu/blob/master/art/main.gif)
<br>
## Usage
### Gradle 
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.jpeng:jpspringmenu:$latestVersion'
}
```
in Activity init
```
    // R.layout.view_menu is your custom menu Layout resourceId
    SpringMenu menu = new SpringMenu(this,R.layout.view_menu);
    
    // do something config for menu...
```
Don't forget to Rewrite dispatchTouchEvent in Activity
```
    @Override
    public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) {
         return menu.dispatchTouchEvent(ev);
    }
```
With SpringConfig, you can change the power and speed of the menu and child layout
```
    /*Another way to construct SpringConfig is that fromBouncinessAndSpeed
     friction : 2f -4f is the most suitable range,Too small,very fast,flexible.too big,but slow
     friction can not be 0f,If the value is 0, it will bounce back indefinitely,According to the definition of rebound API
    */
    mSpringMenu.setMenuSpringConfig(SpringConfig.fromOrigamiTensionAndFriction(20,3));
    mSpringMenu.setChildSpringConfig(SpringConfig.fromOrigamiTensionAndFriction(20, 5));
```
If there are some conflicts with slider controls and menus, you can try 
addIgnoreView to ignore them
```
    mSpringMenu.addIgnoreView(...);
```
MenuListener can use to listening the menu event,there are three callbacks in it:
```
    //opened CallBack
    void onMenuOpen();
    //closed CallBack
    void onMenuClose();
    
    /**
     * When the menu is opening or closing,the method will call back(contain dragging arc)
     * @value: 0f-2f,0f indicates that the menu is closed,2f indicates that opening
     * @bouncing: this Boolean value is used to determine whether or not it is in bouncing,
     * when in bouncing,The value is infinitely close to 2f,else is 0f
     */
    void onProgressUpdate(float value,boolean bouncing);

```
The remaining part of the more important Api
```
     //Content Page dark effect
     setFadeEnable(boolean);
     
     // distance of Allow the menu to begin dragging
     setDragOffset(float);
     
     setMenuListener(MenuListener);
     
     setDirection(int direction);
```
